## Matchbets.com
###### 2019-2022
#### Technical lead

::: details Details
Matchbets.com (former Handspit.com) is a legal licensed online sportsbook focused on the North American market. Applications of this kind place high demands on the security, reliability, performance and scalability of the system. I conducted business analysis, created an architecture, design and developed the core of the system (Java, Vue.js, PHP, MySQL/Aurora), integrated it with Betradar and LSports data providers (Java, RabbitMQ), and various payment processors (MoneyMatrix, iPayTotlal, PayPal, Coinbase, EcoPayz and more). Deployed the system in AWS Cloud utilizing CI/CD (Jenkins) and AWS technologies and best practices.

Latest projects:

**Surebet scannet/bot automation**: Software system that scraps in real-time data from online sportsbooks and runs surebet (arbitrage) and other strategies to analyze and find most valuable bets. Contains a betting automation bot (Puppeteer) which automatically places bets on selected sportsbooks.

The system runs on Hetzner Cloud, with thousands of concurrent asynchronous threads fetching and analyzing gigabytes of data every minute. Bypasses sportsbooks’ anti-bot protection. For searching suitable strategies for value bets Big Data and mathematical modeling methods were utilized.
