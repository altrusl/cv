## Skills

I met Java in 1996 when it was 1 year old and it's my love for life. It is a perfect choice for building enterprise-level applications. I've built several large reliable and robust systems on Java for financial institutions, gaming industry and DARPA research projects.

But for front-end and non-complex back-end, I prefer Vue.js, ES6, PHP and Node.js.

I can and like to manage the entire software development process - from sketching client's ideas and usage scenarios, to determining its basic business needs, through business analysis and design, data modeling, development, testing, to deployment on cloud platform.
