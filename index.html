					<h2>Skills</h2>



					<p>
						I met <strong>Java</strong> in 1996 when it was 1 year old and it is my love for life. 
						It's a perfect choice for constructing enterprise level applications.
						I've built several large reliable and robust systems on Java for financial institutions, 
						gambling industry and DARPA research projects.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						For front-end and non-complex back-end i prefer <strong>Vue.js</strong>, Javascript and PHP.
					</p>

					<p>
						I can manage the entire software development process - from sketching usage scenarios on paper 
						with a client to determine his basic business needs through design, data modeling, development, testing, 
						to deployment on AWS, GCP or Hetzner.
					</p>

					<p>For 24 years i've been working with many languages and technologies.
						It does not make much of a sense to list all of them, here are the main ones.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Languages: Java (20+ years), Javascript/ES6, UML, PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS</li>
						<li>Technologies: OOD/OOP, J2EE, GIT, CI/CD, PWA, UX/UI, Android SDK, Web Services, SaaS, SOAP, RESTful API</li>
						<li>Databases: Oracle, MySQL, PosgreSQL, MongoDB, CouchDB</li>
						<li>Frameworks and servers: WebLogic, Spring, Glassfish, Tomcat, Vue.js, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Symfony, webextensions</li>
						<li>Platforms: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform</li>
						<li>Design patterns, best practices, coding standards</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 class="major">How it works</h2>
					
					<p>I am a Top rated (100% JSS) freelancer on a 
						<a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01175193d8379e5f35?viewMode=1" target="_blank">Upwork</a>. 
						Work on a project is not just a coding, it's rather collaboration with a client.
					</p>
					<img alt="" src="assets/images/design-thinking-process.png">

					<p>
						I'd like to describe one such experience as a use-case that outlines my approach
					</p>

					<p>
						It is an ongoing project for German department of education - system utilizing Vue.js and CouchDB 
						for managing curricula for high schools.
					</p>

					<p>
						Before i entered the project the client had been developing this system for more then a year. 
						He changed several developers, and i can't say that they were all low-paid.
					</p>
					<p>
						The code was a mess. Each programmer tried to do something different. 
						Even as an MVP (Minimum viable product) it can hardly be considered.						
						There were no coding, deploying or any other standards or conventions. 
						No SRS (Software requirements specification) of course, no any other documentation. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						After clarifying the situation i discussed with the client his business needs and goals. 
						Then we determined basic functional requirements for the system.
						For that i created several UML diagrams.
						Then we set up the appropriate data model.
					</p>
					<p>
						After that i started refactoring the code according to the new chosen architecture. 
						Also i started creating documentation for the project.
						Its purpose is to describe the project, to simplify understanding of it for both new developers and the client.
						Example of such documentation can be seen <a href="http://didaktik.digital/sifc/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
						I think internal documentation is a very important artifact in software development. 
						Many programmers don't document their work because they want to bind a client to them.
					</p>
					<p>
						After implementation of new architecture was done a development of new features went much faster. 
						The application has become much more reliable, scalable and maintainable. 
						I had set up CI/CD for automatic project build after each commit to the repository and did some other DevOps stuff.
						This saved a lot of developer time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many other things were done and after 6 weeks of work i got from the client this feedback on Upwork:
					</p>
					<img alt="" src="assets/images/feedback.png">
					

					<p>
						Other feedbacks can be found on my <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01175193d8379e5f35?viewMode=1">Upwork profile</a> 
						although my main projects are on other platforms.

					<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>

					<p>
						Below is a description of four of my recent projects.
					</p>

					<div class="projects-bar">
						<button class="scrollTo" data-target="#website">Website</button>
						<button class="scrollTo" data-target="#sb">Sportsbook</button>

					<h2 id="website">CV website</h2>
					<p>
						First one is this website. Sure it's very simple, but it still shows something. 
					</p>
					<p>
						It is fast - it gets 100% on Google Pagespeed. 
						
						It is 11KB gzipped without images. Javascript code consists of about a hundred lines and does not use any libraries
						(don't use any third-party stuff if you can do without it). It passes W3C. The code is well-formed and neat.
						It is grinded and polished.
					</p>

					<p>
						I like a minimalistic approach with clean, clear and understandable code.
						You can take a look at the source code on <a href="https://github.com/altrusl/cv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
					</p>
					

					<h2 id="sb">Sportsbook</h2>

					<img alt="" src="assets/images/sportsbook.jpg">

					<p>
						Legal licensed online sportsbook targeted to the North American market. 
						Applications of this kind place high demands on the security, reliability, performance and scalability of the system.
						My roles included architect, lead developer, DevOps engineer.
					</p>
					<p>
						I wrote the core of the website (javascript, Vue.js, PHP, MySQL), integrated it with Sportradar - 
						the largest provider of odds data (java, RabitMQ), and with MoneyMatrix and Bambora - payment solution providers. 
						Deployed the system on AWS EC2 cluster, tuned load balancing and security. 
					</p>
					<p>
						From technical point of view, the most interesting and difficult part was to provide to a large number of users 
						(tens of thousands at the same time) the proper quality of services.
						For this purpose custom caching system was developed.
					</p>


					<h2 id="scanner">SureBets scanner</h2>

					<img alt="" src="assets/images/scanner.jpg">

					<p>
						Software system that collects in real-time odds from different online sportsbooks
						and runs surebets (arbitrage) and other strategies to analyze and find most valuable stakes
					</p>
					<p>
						The system grabs events/odds data using website scrapping from several major sportsbook sites - 
						Betfair, Pinnacle, Mozzartbet and others. 
						Odds update interval (for some particular sport) can be less then 1 second 
						(depends on network conditions and target website performance).
					</p>
					<p>
						As an add-on i wrote a betting automation bot on Puppeteer (javascript) 
						which automatically places bets on selected sportsbooks.
					</p>

					<p>
						The system runs on Hetzner servers, with hundreds and thousand 
						asynchronously working threads fetching and analyzing gigabytes of data every minute.
						Technically it was a challenge to bypass sportsbook bot defense.
					</p>

					<p>
						To search for suitable strategies Big Data and mathematical modeling methods were used.
					</p>


					<h2 id="vuesence">Vuesence</h2>

					<p>
						This is my open source project and NPM module
					</p>
					<p>
						In Vue.js development the use of SFCs (single file components) has become the de-facto standard. 
						But there is no convenient tool for documenting such components like, for example, javadoc for java classes.
						The existing solutions on the market (vuedoc, vuese, jsdoc, styleguidist) lack functionality.
					</p>
					<p>
						This product is designed to fill this niche.
						It parses SFC component code into markdown and then uses some website generation tool 
						for generating the documentation in human readable form.
